          I am passionate about all things related to
          multimedia creation. 
          From animation, design, video games, movies, to
          programming, I enjoy exploring it all.
          <br/><br/> I studied Multimedia at <a href="https://www.citm.upc.edu/" target="_blank" class="text-main">CITM UPC</a>, and it was there that I discovered web programming and
          the big picture surrounding it. I found it easier to understand and
          learn than other subjects. Since then, I've been self-taught and have
          taken various courses and completed a bootcamp at <a href="https://www.ironhack.com/es/barcelona" target="_blank" class="text-main">Ironhack</a> in frontend
          development. 
          <br/><br/>
          I enjoy creating
          things that can add value. I've worked in the communication sector and
          have been able to handle pressure and responsibility well. I have
          experience in project management and agile methodology.
          
          <br/><br/>
          I am open to new
          challenges and opportunities in the tech industry. 
          My goal is to grow as a professional and learn backend skills.
