					I am a passionate frontend developer with a strong foundation in
					modern web technologies and a keen eye for design. My journey into the
					tech industry began during my Multimedia studies at
					<a

						class="text-main hover:text-purple"
					>
						CITM UPC </a
					>, where I discovered my love for web programming. What started as an
					academic interest quickly turned into a career fueled by curiosity and
					continuous learning.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-2">
					Over the years, I've evolved into a mid-level frontend developer with
					expertise in technologies like React, Next.js, and architecture
					design. My experience working on the implementation of a comprehensive
					design system has given me a deep understanding of the synergy between
					design and development. I thrive on bridging the gap between aesthetic
					precision and functional efficiency.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-2">
					Beyond coding, I have a solid background in project management and
					agile methodologies, developed through hands-on experience in
					collaborative and fast-paced environments. I take pride in my ability
					to handle responsibility, adapt to challenges, and consistently
					deliver value.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-2">
					I’m always eager to expand my skill set, and my next goal is to deepen
					my knowledge of backend technologies. I’m looking forward to taking on
					new challenges, contributing to impactful projects, and continuing to
					grow as a professional in the tech industry.
